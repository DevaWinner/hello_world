# Overview

As a software engineer, I am learning continuously and enhancing my skills by exploring new tools, languages, and practices. This project is a simple and meaningful step toward building a personal software portfolio.

The software is a "Hello World" program written in Python. It prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal, along with a personalized message that shows my enthusiasm for starting this journey.

The purpose of creating this software is to set up a well-documented GitHub repository, familiarize myself with documentation process, and build a strong foundation for future projects. It serves as a starting point for showcasing my programming skills and documenting my learning process.
