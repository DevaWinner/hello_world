# Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to continuously learn and enhance my skills by exploring new tools, languages, and practices. This project is a simple yet meaningful step toward building a comprehensive personal software portfolio. It demonstrates the basics of Python programming and introduces the documentation standards that I will follow in future projects.

The software is a "Hello World" program written in Python. It prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal, with a personalized message that reflects my enthusiasm for starting this journey.

The purpose of creating this software is to set up a well-documented GitHub repository, familiarize myself with Python, and build a strong foundation for future projects. It serves as a starting point for showcasing my programming skills and documenting my learning process.
